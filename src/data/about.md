# Intro

I am a Technical Solutions Operations Engineer at Datadog where I work on tools that enable the Technical Solutions team to provide support to over 19,000 Datadog customers. Before Datadog, I taught at the educational sailing programs Sea Education Association and Call of the Sea and also worked in Technical Support at Epic and as a QA Engineer at Veyo. In my spare time I sail on the Hudson river out of the Hudson River Community Sailing club, visit other countries, and work on personal coding projects (like this website).

# Fun facts

- I'm originally from a small town in Maryland outside of Washington D.C. but have also lived in Middlebury, Madison, San Diego, San Francisco, and New York City.
- I can use a sextant and a nautical almanac to determine my location (provided the sky is clear and I can see the horizon).
- I bought my first boat, a 1980 Hobie 16, in 2014 having never sailed one and fell in love with flying a hull ever since.
- The first program I ever wrote was in NQC (Not Quite C) for the LEGO Mindstorms programmable brick at an Engineering camp when I was 12.
- I once drove across the United States in 3 days (San Francisco to Maryland).
- There was only a brief several month period during my childhood when my family did not have any dogs. Otherwise we usually had 2, sometimes 3!
- I joined the rowing team in college and won the "Iron Man" award that goes to the hardest working first year rower. The prize was a cast iron skillet I still use to this day.
